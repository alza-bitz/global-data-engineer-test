# Technical Architecture

## Overview

This document provides detailed technical information about the Podcast Analytics Data Pipeline architecture, including data models, quality frameworks, and technical constraints.

## Data Models

### Bronze Layer (Raw)
- `raw_events`: Ingested JSON event data with minimal processing
- `raw_events_validated`: Raw data with validation error tracking

### Silver Layer (Cleansed)
- `cleansed_events`: Cleaned, normalized, and deduplicated events
- `users` & `episodes`: Reference data (dbt seeds)

### Gold Layer (Analytics)
- `fact_user_interactions`: Central fact table for all user interactions
- `dim_users`: User dimension table with demographics
- `dim_episodes`: Episode dimension table with metadata

## Data Quality Framework

### Validation Rules
- **Null checks**: Ensuring required fields are populated
- **Type validation**: Verifying data types match expected formats
- **Range checks**: Validating timestamps and numeric values are within reasonable bounds
- **Referential integrity**: Ensuring foreign key relationships are maintained

### Error Tracking
- Comprehensive error logging for data quality issues
- Validation errors stored alongside data for investigation
- Clear separation between valid and invalid records

### Test Coverage
Over 15 dbt tests ensuring data quality at each layer:
- Schema tests for data types and constraints
- Custom tests for business logic validation
- Referential integrity tests between fact and dimension tables
- Row count validation between pipeline stages

## Assumptions and Technical Constraints

### Database Choice

#### DuckDB for Development
- **Rationale**: Chosen for local development due to excellent JSON/CSV support, SQL compliance, and zero-configuration setup
- **Benefits**: 
  - Native JSON parsing capabilities
  - ANSI SQL compliance
  - No server setup required
  - Excellent performance for analytical workloads
- **File-based Storage**: Suitable for the scale of this demonstration project

#### Future Snowflake Migration
- **Design Compatibility**: Architecture designed to support production Snowflake deployment
- **SQL Portability**: Using standard SQL features that translate between DuckDB and Snowflake
- **dbt Support**: Both databases are well-supported by dbt-core

### Data Processing Assumptions

#### File-based Ingestion
- **Event Data Arrival**: Event data arrives as JSON files in a designated directory
- **File Format**: NDJSON (newline-delimited JSON) with one event per line
- **File Naming**: Files can have any name, uniqueness tracked by filename
- **File Stability**: Files are assumed to be immutable once placed in the data directory

#### Incremental Processing
- **New Data Identification**: New data identified by filename, supports reprocessing
- **Idempotency**: Pipeline can be run multiple times safely
- **Deduplication**: Handles potential duplicates across file boundaries
- **State Management**: Uses dbt's incremental materialization for efficiency

#### Reference Data Stability
- **User Data**: User and episode data changes infrequently (handled as dbt seeds)
- **Update Frequency**: Reference data updated manually when business rules change
- **Data Integrity**: Reference data assumed to be pre-validated and complete

#### Event Ordering
- **Processing Order**: Events processed in file order, with deduplication handling potential duplicates
- **Timestamp Ordering**: No assumption about chronological ordering within files
- **Conflict Resolution**: Latest record by load_at timestamp wins during deduplication

### Time Range Constraints

#### Historical Analysis
- **Test Data Period**: Test data spans 2024, analysis questions use this timeframe
- **Production Adaptation**: Date ranges easily configurable for production data
- **Rolling Windows**: Analysis supports configurable time windows

#### 7-Day Windows
- **Window Calculation**: Analysis windows calculated relative to configurable end dates
- **Boundary Handling**: Inclusive start date, exclusive end date for consistency
- **Parameterization**: End dates can be overridden via dbt variables

#### Timezone Handling
- **UTC Standard**: All timestamps assumed to be in UTC
- **Conversion Strategy**: No timezone conversion performed (assumes source data is normalized)
- **Future Enhancement**: Architecture supports timezone-aware processing if needed

## Data Flow Architecture

### ELT Pattern Implementation

1. **Extract & Load**: 
   - Raw JSON files loaded directly into DuckDB
   - Minimal transformation during load
   - Preserves original data for auditability

2. **Transform**: 
   - Multi-stage transformation using dbt
   - Validation → Cleansing → Analytics layers
   - Each stage builds incrementally on the previous

3. **Analytics**: 
   - Star schema optimized for OLAP queries
   - Pre-aggregated views for common analysis patterns
   - Dimension tables provide rich context for fact data

### Medallion Architecture Layers

#### Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- **Purpose**: Landing zone for all incoming data
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Append-only for auditability
  - Minimal schema enforcement
  - Preserves data lineage information
- **Tables**: `raw_events`, `raw_events_validated`

#### Silver Layer (Cleansed Data)
- **Purpose**: Cleaned, validated, and normalized data
- **Characteristics**:
  - Business rules applied
  - Data quality validated
  - Standardized formats
- **Tables**: `cleansed_events`, `users`, `episodes`

#### Gold Layer (Analytics)
- **Purpose**: Analytics-ready data models
- **Characteristics**:
  - Optimized for query performance
  - Star schema design
  - Aggregated and enriched data
- **Tables**: `fact_user_interactions`, `dim_users`, `dim_episodes`

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- **Indexes**: Leverage DuckDB's automatic indexing for common query patterns
- **Partitioning**: Consider date-based partitioning for large datasets
- **Materialization**: Strategic use of table vs view materialization based on query frequency

### Scalability Planning
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Architecture supports migration to distributed systems (Snowflake)
- **Incremental Processing**: Minimizes processing time for new data
- **Storage Efficiency**: Columnar storage optimized for analytical queries

### Resource Management
- **Memory Usage**: DuckDB efficiently manages memory for large datasets
- **Disk I/O**: Optimized file formats reduce I/O overhead
- **Parallelization**: Takes advantage of modern multi-core processors

## Future Enhancements

### Production Readiness
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling and alerting mechanisms
- **Monitoring**: Data pipeline monitoring and observability
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization for data access
- **Backup**: Data backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Feature Extensions
- **Real-time Processing**: Streaming data ingestion capabilities
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning model integration
- **Data Catalog**: Automated data discovery and documentation
- **API Layer**: REST API for programmatic data access

### Operational Improvements
- **Automated Testing**: Continuous integration for data pipeline testing
- **Data Lineage**: Enhanced tracking of data transformations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Query performance optimization
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource usage monitoring and optimization
