# Development approach

This project was developed using an iterative, slice-based approach as outlined in the [development approach instructions](../.github/instructions/development_approach.instructions.md). The methodology combines:

## Two-Level Iteration Strategy
1. **Outer Level**: Analysis question slices
   - First slice: Top 10 most completed episodes (past 7 days)
   - Second slice: Listen-through rate by country
   - Third slice: Multi-episode listening patterns

2. **Inner Level**: ELT pipeline steps for each slice
   - Extract and Load
   - Transform: Validation
   - Transform: Cleanse
   - Transform: Analytics
   - Analysis Questions (SQL queries)

## Implementation Philosophy
- **Incremental delivery** - Each slice delivers working end-to-end functionality
- **Test-driven development** - Comprehensive testing at each pipeline step
- **Database portability** - Built for DuckDB first, designed for Snowflake migration
- **Collaborative iteration** - Code review and feedback at each step

This approach ensures that each analysis question is fully functional before moving to the next, while building reusable pipeline components that support all subsequent questions.
