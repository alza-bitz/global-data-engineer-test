We will work together to implement the solution end-to-end by "slice", where the goal of each slice is to answer one of the analysis questions in part 3.

So for each question, we shall implement just enough of the ELT pipeline steps needed to answer the question, in order:

1. Extract and load
2. Transform: validation
3. Transform: cleanse
4. Transform: analytics
5. Analysis questions as SQL queries

So we are iterating at two levels, the outer level by analytics question and the inner level by ELT pipeline step.

In each question/step combination, we will work together to implement the code and tests needed, and I will provide feedback on any code you generate before we move on to the next step or question.
